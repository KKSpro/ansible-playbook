#prerequestie : docker must be installed on remote machine
#               there remote machine should be in ssh with local local machine
#				to run ansible playbook on local machine ansible must be there
#               you may also copy the website folder for apache container
#               you should have haproxy configuration(vary with conf.) file on local machine for copying it on remote one
